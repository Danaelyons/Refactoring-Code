# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this assignment I have ...
    -Updated Div tags to alter them into semantic elements.
    -Added the id for link reference & added alt attributes for inclusive accessibility. This way, the visually impaired are able to use my website without coming across issues.
    -Narrowed down the CSS code by consolidating benefits and links to simplify the coding. This way, the coding isn't overwhelmingly lengthy.
